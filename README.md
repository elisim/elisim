Hi! My name is Eli Simhayev. 
I worked as ML Research Engineer at BeyondMinds in the Tabular & Time-Series domain. 
Before that, I completed my M.Sc research on uncertainty estimation at Ben-Gurion University
and worked on generating tabular synthetic data using GANs.

I'm passionate about applied research and ML systems in large-scale. Programming & Machine Learning are important aspects of my personal life, as well as professional. 

In my free time, I like to practice Vipassana meditation ðŸ™‚
